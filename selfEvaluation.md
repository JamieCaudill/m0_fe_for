# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I will definitely need some practice with the `for` statement.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It was hard, but in a good way. I had to reach out for help with one concept, and it paid off. Saki was quick to see the error in my code. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I will continue to practice this concept. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
No questions.
